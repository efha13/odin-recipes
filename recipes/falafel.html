        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h3>Falafel</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>225g dried chickpeas, <em>don't use canned one!</em></li>
            <li>1 cup parsley leaves, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup coriander/cilantro leaves, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>6 scallions/shallots, white and light green only finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon coriander</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons flour, plain/all purpose OR chickpea flour</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Frying</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>500ml vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Tahini Sauce</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>4 tablespoons tahini</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        
        <h3>Falafel</h3>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Place chickpeas in a large bowl and pour over plenty of cold water. Leave to soak 12 + hours (even 2 days is fine).</li>
            <li>Drain chickpeas well. Place in food processor, add remaining Falafel ingredients.</li>
            <li>Blitz for 2 to 3 minutes on high, scraping down sides as necessary, until the chickpeas are very small grains. Mixture should look like smooth guacamole from the outside.</li>
            <li>Scoop up heaped tablespoons and shape into balls (or dome, disc or torpedo), place on a tray. Should make around 20, about 2.5cm / 1" wide.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour oil in a skillet or large pot - at least 1.7 cm / 2/3" depth (Note 4). Heat on medium high to 180 - 190C / 355F (or drop a bit in, should sizzle energetically).</li>
            <li>Place a ball in a large spoon (or tongs) and slide ball in. Cook in batches for around 4 minutes, using 2 forks to roll, until deep golden and super crusty on the outside.</li>
            <li>Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining falafel.</li>
            <li>Serve fresh out of the fryer with Tahini sauce! Make falafel wraps or plates with tabbouleh, tomato, onion, and Tahini sauce.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Tahini Sauce</h3>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Combine tahini and lemon juice, and mix well. The mixture will stiffen.</li>
            <li>Stir in the water 1 tbsp at a time and it will loosen again. The final consistency should be like a thick drizzle sauce. Season to taste with salt.</li>
        </ol>

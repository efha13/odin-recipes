        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h3>Falafels</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>225g dried chickpeas, <em>don't use canned one!</em></li>
            <li>1 cup parsley leaves, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup coriander/cilantro leaves, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>6 scallions/shallots, white and light green only finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon coriander</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons flour, plain/all purpose OR chickpea flour</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Frying</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500ml vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Tahini Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tablespoons tahini</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Butter a 33x23 cm baking dish.</li>
            <li>Toss together nuts and cinnamon. Unroll phyllo and cut the whole stack in half to fit the dish. Cover phyllo with a damp cloth while assembling the baklava, to keep it from drying out.</li>
            <li>Place 2 sheets of phyllo in the bottom of the prepared dish. Brush generously with some of the melted butter. Sprinkle 2 to 3 tablespoons of the nut mixture on top. Repeat layers until all ingredients are used, ending with about 6 sheets of phyllo.</li>
            <li>Using a sharp knife, cut baklava into 4 long rows, then diagonally 9 times to make 36 diamond shapes. Be sure to cut all the way through to the bottom of the layers.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and crisp, about 50 minutes.</li>
            <li>While baklava is baking, combine sugar and water in a small saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Stir in honey, vanilla, and lemon zest; reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove baklava from the oven and immediately spoon syrup over it. Let cool completely before serving. Store uncovered.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Eggs Benedict is a brunch specialty consisting of hot buttered English muffins, Canadian-style bacon, and poached eggs topped with a rich homemade Hollandaise sauce. Wonderful for Easter, Mother's Day, or brunch anytime! If you're not a lemon fan, start with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. If you like a tangy Hollandaise, you can add the full amount.</p>

        </ul>

        <h3>For the Eggs Benedict</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar</li>
            <li>8 eggs</li>
            <li>8 strips Canadian-style bacon</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>

       
        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <h3>Make the Hollandaise sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk egg yolks, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of water, Worcestershire sauce, and white pepper in the top of a double boiler over simmering water.</li>
            <li>Add melted butter, 1 or 2 tablespoons at a time, while whisking yolks constantly.</li>
            <li>If Hollandaise begins to get too thick, add a teaspoon or two of hot water.</li>
            <li>Continue whisking until all of the butter is incorporated.</li>
            <li>Whisk in salt, then remove from heat. Place a lid on the pan to keep sauce warm.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Poach the eggs</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large saucepan with 7cm of water and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium-low, pour in vinegar, and keep water at a gentle simmer.</li>
            <li>Crack an egg into a small bowl then gently slip egg into simmering water, holding the bowl just above the surface of water.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the remaining eggs.</li>
            <li>Cook eggs until whites are firm and yolks have thickened but are not hard, 2 Â½ to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove eggs from water with a slotted spoon, dab on a kitchen towel to remove excess water, and place onto a warm plate.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Cook the bacon and muffins</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Set an oven rack about 17cm from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
            <li>Brown bacon in a medium skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Toast English muffins on a baking sheet under the preheated broiler.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Serve the Eggs Benedict</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread toasted muffins with softened butter and top each one with a slice of bacon, followed by one poached egg.</li>
            <li>Place 2 muffins on each plate and drizzle with Hollandaise sauce.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with chopped chives and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
